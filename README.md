# Tailwind onepage website

Exercice made for my web development course.

This was my first try with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) implementing a public mockup from [NicePage](https://nicepage.com/).

The aim was to have no css file, and be as close as possible from the mockup on each device option.

# What I learn

Tailwind is a really straight forward tool, which has allowed me to implement all the css of the website in only one day (around 8 hours). I had to create some custom configs to be closer to the mockup design, but this is made easy with a simple script in the head of the HTML.

The biggest challenge was to deal with flexbox options, which in the end required to think first as if I was coding vanilla HTML.

# Possible next challenge

The next test could be to install all Tailwind and not only use the CDN. And perhaps create a multipage website.
